Adding a new field for an activity type in the Results Framework app
===


Case Study
==
A request was made to add a new field in every activity type where there is a ```male_count``` and a ```female_count```.

For this tutorial, we focus on the *trainings* activity type. Once complete, we actually need to make this set of changes for *each* of the other activity types where gender counts are mentioned.

The new field in this case is ```transgender_count```.

This change requires one change in the database and changes to five files in the app.

All of the file changes are summed up here, in this commit:
